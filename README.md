    </p># Autocomplete System

This Java program implements an autocomplete system using a Trie data structure. 
It allows users to input a prefix and get suggestions for words starting with that prefix from a given dictionary file.

## Features
- **Efficient Word Lookup:** Uses a Trie (prefix tree) for quick retrieval of words.
- **Custom Dictionary:** Load your own dictionary file to provide word suggestions.
- **Case-Insensitive Search:** Handles words without considering case sensitivity.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Uses depth-first search to explore possible word completions.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Place your dictionary file in the root directory of the project.
3. Update the file path in the code (variable `dictionaryPath`) to point to your dictionary file.
4. Compile and run the program using a Java compiler.
5. Enter a prefix to receive autocomplete suggestions.

## Code Overview
The main components of the code are:
- **TrieNode:** Represents a node in the Trie.
- **Trie:** Provides methods to insert words, search for prefixes, and retrieve autocomplete suggestions.
- **Autocompletesystem:** The main class that integrates the Trie with a dictionary file and user input.
